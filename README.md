# klipper-macros
Collection of useful macros I have developed for Klipper


## Summary
This repo contains a collection of klipper macros I have found useful, mainly for tuning printers and new filaments. 
Some macros have come from other repos or have been inspired from various g-code generators. 
Each macro will be attributed to the original source where open source code has been used. If any attribution is incorrect please let me know so I can resolve.


## Installation
Installation is fairly simple. 

1. ssh into your klipper host
2. `cd` to your klipper config directory (usually `~/printer_data/config` if kiauh was used to setup klipper)
3. create a new directory for these macros `mkdir klipper_macros`
4. `cd` into the new directory `cd klipper_macros`
5. clone this repo `git clone `git clone git@github.com:rosscon/klipper-macros.git . ` (dont forget to include the trailing '.')
6. add each macro you wish to use below to your printer.cfg file `[include klipper_macros/<macro_filename>.cfg]` changing `<macro_filename>`



## Usage

### Retraction
Based on the gcode generator from [Teaching Tech](https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html#retraction) is a macro version from the gcode generated by the online tool.
The macro allows you to enter much of the same details as the online tool by defining values for each increment. 

To enable add `[include klipper_macros/tune_retraction.cfg]` to your printer.cfg

To use the macro you can either use the mainsail/fluid web gui or enter the below gcode into the console modifying the values for your particular test. Each value is fairly self explanitory as to which parameter is altered

```
TUNE_RETRACTION BED_START=60 BED=55 NOZZLE_START=220 NOZZLE=200 PA_START=1.0 A_DIST=1 B_DIST=1.5 C_DIST=2 D_DIST=2.5 E_DIST=3 F_DIST=3.5 A_SPEED=50.0 B_SPEED=50.0 C_SPEED=50.0 D_SPEED=50.0 E_SPEED=50.0 F_SPEED=50.0 A_SPEED_UNRETRACT=25.0 B_SPEED_UNRETRACT=25.0 C_SPEED_UNRETRACT=25.0 D_SPEED_UNRETRACT=25.0 E_SPEED_UNRETRACT=25.0 F_SPEED_UNRETRACT=25.0
```

#### Future plans
* Add a wrapper macro to allow defining start & increment values rather than individual values


### Pressure Advance
A modified version of the pressure advance macro developed by [m0to](https://gist.github.com/m0to/d395d44fa412d9808e0130857ea74f0b). The version included here has been modified to work well for smaller 120x120mm build plates.

To enable add `[include klipper_macros/tune_pressure_advance.cfg]` to your printer.cfg

To use this macro you can either use the mainsail/fluid web gui or enter the below gcode into the console modifying the values for your particular test. Each value is fairly self explanitory as to which parameter is altered

```
TUNE_PRESSURE_ADV BED=70 NOZZLE=190 PA_START=0.5 PA_STOP=1.5 NZL=0.4
```

The macro will echo to the console will output instructions similar to below with instruction on how to calculate a pressure advance value based on which line has the best result. Note that the bottommost line is line 0.

```
Find best line and multiply it by (0.5 + (bestLine * 0.05) ) to find your PA setting.
```
